      title: 'Population Census Data Cleaning',
      description: `As a volunteer data analyst, I undertook the critical task of cleaning and validating unstructured Arabic census data. 
      This involved the development of over 150 validation rules spanning 66 distinct fields. To streamline the error detection process, I implemented 
      automation using Pandas, which facilitated the output of structured JSON reports. Through this rigorous analysis, I successfully identified more
      than 300 data quality issues present in 90% of the 203 census entries.`,
